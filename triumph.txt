TRIUMPH!


a human outpost on a far away planet, attacked by another human faction, not really much of a contest, as the attacking faction is much stronger.  The story will weave together three different perspectives.

COMMANDER 1

The ship was huge.  Gargantuan, really.  It was more like a ship of ships than a single spacecraft.  It carried with it through the blackness of space hundreds of smaller space vessels, many of those having their own ships as well.  In a very similar fashion to that of the old Earth carriers on the sea, except multiplied a hundred times. 

This was the only vessel they sent, too, and it would be all that was needed.  The planet had only a limited population of several hundred thousand, with little technology that could allow them to compete.  The ship exited trans-space after several weeks of travel and stayed in orbit for a couple days, making preparation, before the assault began.  Of course, the humans on the surface hadn't any idea that the craft was even in orbit.  Even with the ship's massive size, precautions could (and were) taken by the ship's commander to be sure the inhabitants of the planet did not detect the vessel before the appropriate time.  To think in the end, the whole episode lasted just under two weeks!

The commander was a hard and young woman, trained specifically for missions such as this.  Molded by years of training, she carried out her duties effectively and with little remorse or joy.
